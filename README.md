## Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abdulkareem
I'm a kickass Front-End Web Developer from Nigeria! I love nothing more than coding up a storm with Figma designs and cloning sleek and professional websites using my favorite frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS. My passion for coding and creating visually stunning, dynamic, and engaging websites is off the charts! As a front-end dev, I've got the skills and experience to make websites look as good as they function. I'm always on top of the latest technologies and trends, and I'm excited to bring my fun and outgoing personality to any project. Let's create something awesome together!
